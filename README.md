# 💾 Installation

Before you download anything, make sure your platform is supported:

- ✅ Any Android version where Among Us works (root not required)
- ❓ Custom / OEM ROMs (may or may not work)
- ❌ Emulators (`frida-java-bridge`, which is required for the menu, doesn't work on them)

Download and install the .apk from [releases](https://github.com/astra1dev/MalumMenu-Android/releases/latest).

Release notes can be found below each [release](../../releases) and in [CHANGELOG.md](/docs/CHANGELOG.md).

> [!WARNING]
> This mod relies on the unstable `frida-java-bridge`. Random crashes and inconsistent behavior may occur.

# ❓ FAQ

- **Q:** How do I know the menu is loaded?  
**A:** You will see a mod icon in the top left corner when you open Among Us.

- **Q:** The menu doesn't appear.  
**A:** Ensure you granted the "Display over other apps" permission. The game should ask for it on the first launch. If not, grant it manually.

- **Q:** Do I need to uninstall the original Among Us before using MalumMenu-Android?  
**A:** Currently yes, as MalumMenu-Android has the same package name, but this may change in the future. In the meantime, you can use an app like [AEE](https://github.com/apk-editor/APK-Explorer-Editor) or [ReVanced](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-manager) that allows you to change the package name.

# 👷‍♂️ Compiling

Requirements:

- Android SDK Build Tools (for objection)
- Python 3.10+ (for Frida & objection)
- Node.js
- Java Development Kit (for APKEditor and apktool)

## Basic Setup

### Create project & install dependencies

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/astra1dev/MalumMenu-Android
cd MalumMenu-Android

# Create and activate a virtual environment (Not necessary, but considered good practice)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install Frida and objection
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install node.js dependencies
npm install
```

### Get the original game APK

This can be done in multiple ways:

- `pip install gplaydl && gplaydl download com.innersloth.spacemafia -a arm64 -o data/split`
- Extract the APK from your phone. Many different apps can do this.
- Download the "Demo" APK from [here](https://innersloth.itch.io/among-us).

Save the APK as `data/AmongUs.apk`. If the APK you got is split into multiple APKs, you need to merge them into a single APK.
You can do this with [APKEditor](https://github.com/REAndroid/APKEditor/releases/latest):
`java -jar APKEditor.jar m -i data/split -o data/AmongUs.apk`

## Development workflow

The following commands compile the script into `./dist/agent.js`:

- `npm run build:release` - release version (minified, optimized)
- `npm run build:dev` - development version
- `npm run watch` - development version with watch mode (rebuilds automatically on file changes)

You should also periodically ensure code quality:

- `npm run lint` - runs [eslint](https://eslint.org/) to check for errors
- `npm run prettier` - runs [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format code

### Script Mode

If you are not modifying the code, use this mode to build and install the APK with the script already embedded.

```sh
# Embed script into APK
objection patchapk -c objection.cfg.json -s data/AmongUs.apk -l dist/agent.js -a arm64-v8a -V 17.18.0 --pause

# In a new terminal session, patch the manifest to add overlay permission
# Replace TEMP_DIR with the path to the temp directory objection tells you.
python tools/patch_manifest.py TEMP_DIR
# Now go back to the previous terminal session and press Enter to tell objection to continue

# Connect your device via ADB, then install the APK on your device
# You can also manually copy the APK to your device and install it, but this is the fastest way
adb install -i com.android.vending data/AmongUs.objection.apk
```

Start the game. The first time you start it, it will ask for "Display over other apps" permission. You should now see the mod icon in the top left corner.

### Listen Mode

If you are modifying the code, use this mode so you don't have to rebuild and reinstall the APK on every change.

```sh
# Embed frida-gadget into APK
objection patchapk -s data/AmongUs.apk -a arm64-v8a -V 17.18.0 --pause

# In a new terminal session, patch the manifest to add overlay permission
# Replace TEMP_DIR with the path to the temp directory objection tells you.
python tools/patch_manifest.py TEMP_DIR
# Now go back to the previous terminal session and press Enter to tell objection to continue

# Connect your device via ADB, then install the APK on your device
# You can also manually copy the APK to your device and install it, but this is the fastest way
adb install -i com.android.vending data/AmongUs.objection.apk
```

- Start the game. The first time you start it, it will ask for "Display over other apps" permission. 
- Every time you start the game, it will immediately pause and wait until you manually spawn the script. (If you check `adb logcat`, something similar to `Frida: Listening on TCP port 27042` should be shown)
- `npm run spawn` - spawn script in gadget mode
- `npm run spawn:server` - spawn script using frida-server (app name needs to be "Among Us")
- You should now see the mod icon in the top left corner.
